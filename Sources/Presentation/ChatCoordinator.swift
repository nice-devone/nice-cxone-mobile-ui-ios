    /// This method initializes a `UIHostingController` with a SwiftUI view, which is presented modally
    /// on the provided `parentViewController`. You have the option of providing a `threadId` to open an existing chat thread.
    /// This feature is used for deep linking into specific chat threads
    /// within a multi-threaded channel configuration to resume previous conversations.

    /// - Note: The `threadId` parameter does not have any effect if the channel configuration is set to single-threaded or live chat
    /// because there is always a single conversation so it's not necessary to handle the `threadId`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - threadId: The unique identifier for the chat thread to be opened (deeplinking). If `nil`,
    ///     the SDK tries to refresh existing conversation(s) or creates a new one for single-thread and live chat configurations.
    ///   - parentViewController: The view controller in which the chat UI will be presented.
    ///   - presentModally: The flag if the content view is going to be presented modally or in full-screen.
    ///   - onFinish: A closure that is executed when the chat session finishes or is dismissed.
    ///
    /// The method will automatically dismiss any currently presented view controller on the `parentViewController`.
